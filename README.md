# ⚡ ChainTrace — Cross-Border Supply Chain Milestone Escrow & Financing

ChainTrace is a decentralized trade coordination and financing protocol built on **Stellar Soroban**. It facilitates trustless global trade by allowing Buyers, Suppliers, Logistics Providers, and Inspectors to manage orders, track delivery milestones, dispute shipments, and release financing payments dynamically based on multi-party state-machine verifications.

---

## 📌 Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Cross-border supply chains suffer from severe counterparty risks and operational opacity:
1. **Lack of Payment Security**: Suppliers fear shipping goods without advance payments, while Buyers fear losing funds to untrusted or delayed shipments.
2. **Coarse-Grained Payouts**: Payment terms are often rigid, preventing incremental payouts matching real logistics progress.
3. **Dispute Vulnerabilities**: If goods are damaged or misrouted, funds get locked up indefinitely due to lack of transparent multi-party state resolution.

### The Solution: ChainTrace
ChainTrace establishes trust by locking Buyer funds in an on-chain Escrow vault and releasing them programmatically based on verifiable logistics milestones:
- **Dual-Contract Architecture**: Separation of order metadata (`order-contract`) from the actual fund locking/release mechanisms (`escrow-contract`) for high security.
- **Inter-Contract state updates**: When a verified logistics provider or inspector updates a shipment milestone, the `order-contract` performs a cross-contract invocation to `escrow-contract` to execute payouts.
- **Role-based dashboard**: Granular control panel with custom modules tailored to **Buyers**, **Suppliers**, **Logistics Providers**, and **Inspectors**.

### ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds the Next.js frontend, runs the lint checkers, compiles the Rust contracts to WebAssembly, and runs both cargo and unit tests upon pushing commits to the main repository:

## 🌟 Progressive Features (Level 1, 2, and 3)

### 👛 Level 1: Core Connectivity & Direct Routing
*   **Multi-Wallet Bridge**: Smooth connection and disconnection handling using the Stellar Wallets Kit (Freighter, xBull, Albedo).
*   **Balance Polling**: Real-time display of connected account balances in XLM, utilizing polling to reflect transaction state changes.
*   **Direct Payments (`/transfer`)**: Secure, validated transfer module supporting recipient address check, input guards, and direct Stellar Testnet transaction submissions.

### ⛓️ Level 2: Inter-Contract State Machine
*   **Dual-Contract Architecture**: 
    *   `order-contract`: Stores order parameters (milestones, roles: Buyer, Supplier, Logistics, Inspector).
    *   `escrow-contract`: Holds buyer's locked funds and handles milestone-specific payout distributions.
*   **Milestone State-Machine**: Tracks transitions from `Created` ➔ `Funded` ➔ `Shipped` ➔ `Delivered` ➔ `Completed` or `Disputed`.
*   **Inter-Contract Invocations**: Auto-invokes payment release hooks inside the `escrow-contract` when specific milestones are marked resolved.
*   **Responsive Control Panel**: Clean, dashboard layouts allowing different actors (Buyer, Supplier, Logistics, Inspector) to perform role-restricted actions with load states.

### 📡 Level 3: Event Logs, Tests, and CI/CD Pipelines
*   **Real-time Event Log**: Dynamic stream pulling event topics and values directly from Soroban RPC ledger logs.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   **Cargo Unit Tests**: 3 Rust smart contract tests validating lifecycle logic and state changes.
    *   **Vitest Suite**: 12 passing tests verifying utility helper conversions (`stroopsToXlm`, `xlmToStroops`, etc.) and key UI components.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Action workflows (`ci.yml`) automating contract compilation, Rust testing, Next.js linting, Vitest runs, and production builds.
